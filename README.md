# Memory Game

This is a simple memory game to help memorize 3 basic css selectors; element, #id and .class. The matching cards are not identical. One card has the html element and the other card has the css selector. The player needs to match the html element with the correct css selector.

The game counts the number of moves the player makes and the time length of the game. When the player completes the game a modal pops up displaying the final count of the steps and time. The player can reset the game anytime during play by pressing the restart button above the cards.

In the starting position the color of the cards is the orange color of the html logo. In the flipped position the color of the cards is the blue color of the css logo. The order of the colors references that we usually first write html and then css to style it.

The font of the game is a monospace font because the code editors that I have seen use monospace fonts as a default.
